# CritInfo
Vanilla's "CritBar" lacks of info, and I cloud't find any good lua for it, so I made one on my own.
This one shows you nothing if crit is ready, but if you need any damage or more shots it will tell you how much.
I made it with help of AI and everything is simple and described so any changes should be easy to do. Font and location of info panel can be adjust in first two lines of code.
