# Wilbind
LMAOBOX doesn't have a proper bind manager, only a few options like aimbot are bindable.
Here's my solution that allows to bind **ANYTHING**!
## Features
- Config saving system (Team Fortress 2/wilconfig)
- Different bind modes:
    - Press - Changes value once when bind is pressed.
    - Hold - Changes value and returns old one when button is relased.
    - Toggle - Changes value and returns old one on second button press.
- Enable / Disable binds globally or in menu
## Known issues
- Menu don't support scrolling, after 7 binds on 1080p binds will be under screen.
    - You can manually edit wilconfig/wilbind.cfg in your TF2 directory and add or edit binds by coping other ones. Try to not brake anything...
### Special thanks to
